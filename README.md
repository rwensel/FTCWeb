# FTCWeb

The purpose of this personal project was to teach myself Django, Python, API, machine learning, Facebook Graph, OOP, SQL, webscraping, metadata indexing.
All of this code is original, however some of it does use tecniques hand picked from other learning materials.

There are really three things within this GIT. One is a dJango personal site/blog handwritten. The 2nd portion is an API created to send 
requests to the Facebook Graph API to send/retrieve certain information such as login, page chat, posts, submit post, remove post, reactions. This
API can then be used to make calls using functions within dJango and BOTS. The 3rd potion is a Python scripted AI BOT for facebook that interacts with
page chat submissions. This is built on a tiny trained model that I created for learning. The goal was automated/smart replies with the ability to return
functions such as time/date, WIKI questions, data query and request images or posts from reddit by keywords.

Originally I had this setup to run on a HEROKU free hosting package using docker however I now have created an in home server that runs docker services and plan to be hosting it off my own hardware. Currently I have put this on hold as I have not had time to dedicate to it but I do plan on picking it back up later and hopefully not have forgotten everything that I had learned. ;)
