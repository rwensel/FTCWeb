# FTCWeb

The purpose of this personal project was to teach myself Django, Python, API, machine learning, Facebook Graph, OOP, SQL, webscraping, metadata indexing

There are really three things within this GIT. One is a dJango personal site/blog handwritten. The 2nd portion is an API created to send 
requests to the Facebook Graph API to send/retrieve certain information such as login, page chat, posts, submit post, remove post, reactions. This
API can then be used to make calls using functions within dJango and BOTS. The 3rd potion is a Python scripted AI BOt for facebook that interacts with
page chat submissions. This is built on a tiny trained model that I created for learning. The goal was automated/smart replies with the ability to return
functions such as time/date, WIKI questions, data query and request images or posts from reddit by keywords.
